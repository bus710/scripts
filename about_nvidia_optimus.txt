For mint linux 18.3, I had an issue with nvidia properitary driver.
Some manual work is requred to boot well.

1. USB installer 
- compatibility mode booting 
- install Mint

2. First time
- compatibility mode booting again
- install nvidia driver from Control Panel.
- assign nosplash and pci=noacpi for /etc/default/grub (and update-grub)
- reboot

3. Second time
- normal booting
- because noacpi parameter nividia-setting cannot show nvidia properitary GUI
- but it shows prime setting

If don't configure pci=noacpi?
intel mode: power control issue can appear (poweroff/reboot)
nvidia mode: fan noise...

I decide not to use nvidia mode in normal use.

summary
- utilize compatibility mode and nosplash
- don't use nvidia with noacpi
- use intel with noacpi
