# Headless

To install these:
- basic packages and environment variables
- nvim (appimage version)
- vim-plug and some plug-ins
- dracula theme for nvim
- Go SDK
- Flutter/Web SDK (not for mobile)
- Docker and Docker composer
- ufw and some configuration

for headless debian/ubuntu servers.

## How to use

Just run one by one from 0 to N in the terminal.
However, check 02, 03, and 04 to pick a certain SDK version of each SDK.

## Start a new project

After the installation, check the sample projects out.
Go can be started from **go mod**.
However, Flutter/Web can be started from the scratch (please use the sample + **flutter packages get**).
